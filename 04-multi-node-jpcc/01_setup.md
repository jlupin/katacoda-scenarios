# JLupin setup

Before proceeding to the next step, please wait until the setup scripts finish running.

In the meantime, here's a brief description of the setup in this scenario. The scripts that are currently running, they are starting up three important processes in the context of Jlupin: jpcc and two separate platforms. In this scenario, you're going to learn managing users in jpcc console, managing jlupin's zones and controlling your cluster consisting of multiple nodes (just like the previous scenario).

While preparing the environment for the scenario, we decided to set up both nodes in `/opt/jlupin`. All files related to `NODE_1` instance are in `/opt/jlupin/platform1`, and all files related to `NODE_2` instance are in `/opt/jlupin/platform2`.
